    <figcaption>When I met Alan he was had the fresh face of a super model and a zest for life.  
    <br>
His hobbies included skateboarding, drinking tennents, playing columns and skanking until dawn.  He was young then.</figcaption>

  <h2> <strong>NOW</strong> Alan's most favourite things are:</h2>
  <div class="Faves"> 
    <p class="cricket">
     The Gentleman's sport that is <a href=https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=38DDC1E17DEF8777&id=38DDC1E17DEF8777%214615&parId=38DDC1E17DEF8777%21560&o=OneUp target="_blank"> Cricket</a>.  One of his fondest memories was when he spent an afernoon at Lords, with his dear friend Tom Staw, eating their way through a basket of strong smelling cheese and marvelling at the length of the neigbouring beer snake.  Alan describes himself as a 'peak athlete' so he plays as well as spectates.  In his late 20's he was a member of the 'Railway Taverners' cricket team in Highgate, London.  The 'Tav's' claim to fame was being beaten in a one day test match by a team of 13 year old girls.

     Alan has had a long standing love affair with <a href=https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=38DDC1E17DEF8777&id=38DDC1E17DEF8777%214616&parId=38DDC1E17DEF8777%21560&o=OneUp target="_blank"> Ale</a>.  His wife however has no time to be jealous of this as she is currently waging war with that harlot 'Diane' the sat-nav lady, who she is convinced is attempting to steal her husband.  Alan has been a fan of ale since he relised that drinking a crate of Carling and coming home wearing a rubbish bin did not befit his model good looks.  It is thanks to 'Ale' that alan invented the popular dance move 'twerking'. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="cat">
     Alan is also very fond of <a href=https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=38DDC1E17DEF8777&id=38DDC1E17DEF8777%214614&parId=38DDC1E17DEF8777%21560&o=OneUp target="_blank"> Jeffery the cat</a> who was the runt of his litter.  Jeffery has a tiny head and a giant arse, his favorite foods are melon rind and celloptape. He has an addiction to 'digging' and likes to be worn as a scarf.
